# Schedule
This is an un-finished project that will hopefully be finished by Christmas as a gift for the General Manager of the Arundel Mills Chipotle.  She spends a few hours each week trying to get a schedule that not only  fits the employee's availability, but also meets the store's needs.  For example, not everyone knows how to cook and cut the meat, so she has to make sure someone with that knowledge is scheduled each shift.  It's a lot to manage, and considering it's a high volume store, time is much needed elsewhere.

So far, the program has the capacity to input the store's employee's data, but using this data to create a schedule has not been implemented yet.

This was my first attempt at using an MVC design pattern, so my Controller and View classes have the potential to be a bit scattered in terms of where things belong.
